# Contribution guidelines


### Code style


please use sonarlint and respect it as much as possible.
always add comment on why you did this or that (I know I'm the first not doing it, but it helps everyone)


### Naming convention


please respect <https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0430-finalizing-naming-conventions.md> \


### When adding new functionality to the bot


first, focus on a working version and after do it more properly and clean (except if you want to do it from the start)
since all new functionality will not be accepted or added having a "prototype" is best.


### When editing an already existing functionality


please tell what has changed and the impact better performance,
more readable, using a new api version.
