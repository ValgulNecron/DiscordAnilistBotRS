# Discord bot that uses the anilist api to get anime/manga info


## **What does it do?**

- Get anime/manga/ln info
- Get anime airing notifications
- Get user info
- Get character info
- Get studio info
- Get staff info
- Generate an image with a seyuu and 4 characters that they voiced
- Get a random anime/manga
- and more... (WIP)

It also convert anilist flavored markdown into discord markdown (and also include "all" the html stuff).

you can find the bot on [github](https://github.com/ValgulNecron/kasuki)
or [add it with](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=923286536445894697&permissions=533113194560&scope=bot)

It also support localisation. If you want to add one you simply need to edit the json file on the github repos. (I will
accept new translation on the repos (if it seems good on deepl), but will not add more myself since I know no one who
speaks other language to help me translate it.)
You can also request feature and report issue.
